# Todo list

This is a simple To do list app, built using the Vue framework. The app allows you to add
items to the list and tag whether they are high or low priority. Items are colour coded
depending on priority.

Ticking an item will mark it as completed. You will then have the option to delete all
completed items from the todo list.
